== Google Books API Sample: Min functionality

=== This app displays a paginated list of "ruby on rails" books, using the Google Books API and jQuery FlexiGrid plugin for visualization.
=== It has HAML, AJAX, SCSS on board. 
=== Information about books from Google Books API duplicates in local SQLite DB in order to show high performance and to save limited number of requests to API. There is a cron task for this functionality implemented with Whenever gem. It refreshes local DB every 3 hours.
=== This is a simpliest configuration so it's performance ~5000 requests per minute in production environment on Ubuntu 12.04/Webrick/SQLite/Athlon XP 2500+/4GB RAM.
